-----------------------------------------------------------------------   RULES   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The rules of the game are as follow:

1) The player is placed in a maze made up of posts. The posts are of two types: electrified and non-electrified. 
2) There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy the player. 
3) If the player touches an electrified post or any of these robots, that is the end of the game (and the player!).
4) The robots are also destroyed when they touch an electrified post or they collide with each other, and they become stuck when they collide with a non-electrified post or another destroyed robot's body.
5) Every time the player moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a contiguous cell, each robot moves one cell closer to the new player's location, in whichever direction is the shortest path. 
6) The robots have no vision sensors but they have an accurate odour sensor that allows them to follow the player!

There is one hope: The maze has one or more exit gates. Reach one of the exit gates, in the shortest time possible, before being electrocuted (by touching an electrified post) or caught by a robot. If the player manages to escape, they WIN.

Screen Symbols:

*= electrified post;
+= non-electrified post:
H= player (alive);

R= robot (alive);
r= robot (destroyed=dead/stuck);
O= exit gate of the maze;
