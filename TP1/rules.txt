-----------------------------------------------------------------------   RULES   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The rules of the game are as follow:

1) The player is placed in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts. 
2) There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy the player. 
3) If the player touches the maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game (and the player!).
4) The robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other (alive or dead).
5) Every time the player moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a contiguous cell, each robot moves one cell closer to the new player's location, in whichever direction is the shortest path. 
6) The robots have no vision sensors but they have an accurate odour sensor that allows them to follow the player!

There is one hope: make the robots hit the maze or each other. If all of them are destroyed, the player WINS.

Screen Symbols:

*= electrical fence or post;
H= player (alive); 
h= player (dead);
R= robot (alive);
r= robot (destroyed=dead/stuck);

Player Controls:

You can move forward, backwards, left or right by pressing W, X, A, D, respectively.
The player is also able to move diagonally by pressing Q, E, Z, C.
If the player chooses to, he can stay in place by pressing S.
The controls can be visualized with the following grid:

------------------
| Q |   W    | E |
|---|--------|---|
| A | Player | D |
|---|--------|---|
| Z |   X    | C |
------------------

Note: The player can exit the game at any time by pressing CTLR + Z (Windows) or CTRL + D (Linux)

Diffuclty Levels:

There are two difficulty levels implemented in the game: Normal and Hard.
-Normal: the robots are initially attributed a turn order and will always move accordingly to that turn order. Robots will likely collide with eachother before one has the chance to move.
-Hard: all the robots move at the same time so they can never colide before moving.
